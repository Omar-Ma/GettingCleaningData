# GettingCleaningData

# How the scripts works?
# First I downloaded the data, unzipped, and put the useful data in the working directory.
# Then I merged the data pieces into one data set.
# Then I extracted only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
# Then I Used descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
# Then I labelled the data set with descriptive variable names
# Finally, from the data set in step 4, I created a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable

# The code book describing the variables
# data: Data frame with different pieces together.
# data1:Data frame with only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
# data2:Data frame with descriptive activity names
# data3:Data frame with descriptive variable names
# data4 and data5: A second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
