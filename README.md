# GettingCleaningData

##How the scripts works?
First I downloaded the data, unzipped, and put the useful data in the working directory.
Then I merged the data pieces into one data set.
Then I extracted only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Then I Used descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Then I labelled the data set with descriptive variable names
Finally, from the data set in step 4, I created a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable
